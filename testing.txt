There is a set of unit tests that covers most routines.
The test framework is a fork of https://github.com/sheredom/utest.h, adapted to work with amiga-gcc.
The tests verify functionality but do not measure performance.

To run the test suite:
* Install CMake 3.10 or newer
* Install Bebbo's amiga-gcc
* Run `cmake clean build`
* copy build/*/*_test to an Amiga/into an emulator, and run the executables
